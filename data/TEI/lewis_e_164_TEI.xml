            <summary>This manuscript is a humanistic emblem book made in France in the late sixteenth century.  The text, written in Latin and Greek, relates enigmas offered by the Sphinx and interpreted by Oedipus, with some French translations added later.  The watercolor illustrations are allegorical scenes incorporating both Christian and classical imagery.  A leaf with a rough draft of an eighteenth-century French translation of the first enigma is bound in as the fourth front flyleaf.  The first two leaves (pages 3-6) are replacements for a missing first leaf, supplying the Latin text of the first dialogue accompanied by a French translation, with the original first watercolor illustration of the manuscript cut out and pasted to the first of the newer leaves (page 3).  The extant original text begins on the third leaf (page 7), in the middle of the first dialogue.  Leaves may also be missing within volume, such as before page 37, which is a single leaf from the end of a Latin dialogue (or the leaf may be out of place).  Eighteenth-century children have written letters of the alphabet, calculations, names (including Morelloet, page 73), and an inscription (page 157) in the margins.</summary>
